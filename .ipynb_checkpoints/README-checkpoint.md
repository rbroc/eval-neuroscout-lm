### Evaluating LLMs on forward language modeling for NeuroScout transcripts
- Data is Neuroscout transcripts
	- Either as is
	- Or with added punctuation
- Evaluate different context windows
- Evaluate the perplexity/surprisal/entropy of the predictions
- Qualitatively inspect the predictions models produce


To dos:
- Missing values: are those NAs (things that can't be aligned?)
- Run
- Note that we may need to evaluate transcripts
- Unrelated
    - Sentiment metrics?
    - Next turn perplexity
