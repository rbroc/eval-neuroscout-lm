1
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,240
How's your blog going?

2
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,600
Yeah, good, very good.

3
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,280
You haven't written a word, have you?

4
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,120
You just wrote
"still has trust issues".

5
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,160
And you read my writing upside down.

6
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,800
You see what I mean?

7
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,720
John, you're a soldier

8
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,360
and it's going to take you
a while to adjust to civilian life

9
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,200
and writing a blog
about everything that happens to you
will honestly help you.

10
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,680
Nothing happens to me.

11
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,680
'What do you mean there's no ruddy
car?' He went to Waterloo, I'm sorry.

12
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,360
Get a cab! I never get cabs!

13
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,200
I love you. When?

14
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,400
Get a cab!

15
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,000
My husband

16
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,200
was a happy man
 lived life to the full.

17
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,520
He loved his family and his work,

18
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,040
and that he should have
taken his own life in this way

19
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,080
is a mystery

20
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,400
and a shock to all who knew him.

21
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,200
Taxi, taxi!

22
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
I'll be just two minutes, mate.
What?

23
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,200
I'm just going home to get
my umbrella. You can share mine.

24
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,640
Two minutes, all right?

25
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,440
She still dancing?

26
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,240
Yeah, if you can call it that.

27
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,320
Did you get the car keys off her?
Got them out of her bag.

28
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,960
Where is she?

29
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,280
The body of Beth Davenport,
Junior Minister for Transport,

30
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,920
was found late last night
on a building site in Greater London.

31
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,560
Preliminary investigations
suggest that this was suicide.

32
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,520
We can confirm that this apparent
suicide closely resembles those of

33
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,280
Sir Jeffrey Patterson
and James Phillimore.

34
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,920
In the light of this, these incidents
are now being treated as linked.

35
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,920
The investigation is ongoing
but Detective Inspector Lestrade
will take questions now.

36
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,280
Detective Inspector,
how can suicides be linked?

37
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,400
Well, they all took the same poison.

38
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
They were all found in places
they had no reason to be.

39
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,760
None of them had shown any prior
indication. But you can't have
serial suicides.

40
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,440
Well, apparently you can.

41
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,480
These three people,
there's nothing that links them?

42
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,000
There's no link we've found yet but

43
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,240
we're looking for it.
There has to be one.

44
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,560
If you've all got texts, please
ignore them. It just says "Wrong".

45
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,960
Well, just ignore that.
If there are no more questions,

46
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm going to bring
this session to an end.

47
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,280
If they're suicides,
what are you investigating?

48
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:47,600
As I say, these suicides
are clearly linked.

49
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,280
It's an unusual situation, we've
got our best people investigating.

50
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,160
Says "Wrong" again.

51
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,360
One more question. Is there any
chance that these are murders?

52
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,120
And if they are, is this
the work of a serial killer?

53
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,960
I know that you like
writing about these but these
do appear to be suicides.

54
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,000
We know the difference. The poison
was clearly self-administered.

55
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,040
Yes, but if they are murders,
how do people keep themselves safe?

56
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,600
Well, don't commit suicide.

57
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,960
Daily Mail!

58
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:27,840
This is a frightening time
for people but all anyone has to do
is exercise reasonable precautions.

59
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,720
We are all as safe as we want to be.

60
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,080
MOBILE PHONES BUZZ

61
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,680
Thank you.

62
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,800
You've got to stop him doing that.
He's making us look like idiots.

63
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
If you can tell me
how he does it, I'll stop him.

64
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,440
John!

65
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,080
John Watson!

66
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,840
Stamford, Mike Stamford.
We were at Barts together.
Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.

67
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,320
Yes, I know, I got fat. No, no.

68
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,120
I heard you were abroad somewhere
getting shot at. What happened?

69
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,600
I got shot.

70
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,600
Are you still at Barts then?

71
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,880
Teaching now, yeah, bright
young things like we used to be.

72
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,960
God, I hate them.

73
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,680
What about you, just staying in
town till you get yourself sorted?

74
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,440
I can't afford London
on an Army pension.

75
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,160
Couldn't bear to be anywhere else.
That's not the John Watson I know.
I'm not the John Watson.

76
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,560
Couldn't Harry help?

77
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,640
Yeah, like that's going to happen(!)

78
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,680
I don't know,
get a flatshare or something?

79
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,360
Who'd want me for a flatmate?

80
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,480
What?

81
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,920
You're the second person
to say that to me today.

82
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,280
Who was the first?

83
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,840
How fresh?

84
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,720
Just in. 67, natural causes.

85
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,880
Used to work here.
I knew him, he was nice.

86
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,120
Fine.

87
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,280
We'll start with the riding crop.

88
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,080
So, bad day was it?

89
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,200
I need to know what bruises
form in the next 20 minutes.
A man's alibi depends on it. Text me.

90
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,520
Listen, I was wondering.
Maybe later, when you're finished...

91
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,600
You're wearing lipstick.
You weren't wearing lipstick before.

92
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,560
I refreshed it a bit.

93
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,080
Sorry, you were saying?

94
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,880
I was wondering
if you'd like to have coffee?

95
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,600
Black, two sugars, please.
I'll be upstairs.

96
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,160
OK.

97
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
KNOCK ON DOOR

98
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,280
Bit different from my day.
You've no idea!

99
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,480
Mike, can I borrow your phone?
There's no signal on mine.

100
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,360
And what's wrong with the landline?
I prefer to text.

101
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,520
Sorry, it's in my coat.

102
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,280
Here, use mine.

103
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,800
Oh, thank you.

104
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,920
This is an old friend of mine,
John Watson.

105
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,320
Afghanistan or Iraq?

106
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,520
Sorry?
Which was it, in Afghanistan or Iraq?

107
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,840
Afghanistan, sorry,
how did you know?

108
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,960
Ah! Coffee, thank you.

109
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,520
What happened to the lipstick?

110
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,360
It wasn't working for me.

111
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,560
Really? It was a big improvement.
Your mouth's too small now.

112
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,120
OK.

113
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,760
How do you feel about the violin?

114
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,520
I'm sorry, what?

115
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,480
I play the violin when I'm thinking
and sometimes I don't talk for days
on end. Would that bother you?

116
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,680
Potential flatmates should know
the worst about each other.

117
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,480
You told him about me? Not a word.

118
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,360
Who said anything about flatmates?

119
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
I did. Told Mike this morning
that I must be a difficult man
to find a flatmate for.

120
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,920
Now here he is just after lunch with
an old friend clearly just home from

121
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,760
military service in Afghanistan.
Wasn't a difficult leap.

122
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,200
How did you know about Afghanistan?

123
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,440
Got my eye on a nice little place
in central London.

124
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,120
We ought to be able to afford it.

125
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,200
We'll meet there tomorrow
evening, seven o'clock.

126
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,120
Sorry, got to dash. I think I left
my riding crop in the mortuary.

127
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,680
Is that it?

128
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,640
Is that what?

129
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,360
We've only just met and we're
going to go and look at a flat?

130
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,120
Problem?

131
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,200
We don't know
a thing about each other.

132
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,720
I don't know where we're meeting,
I don't even know your name.

133
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,760
I know you're an Army doctor
and you've been invalided home
from Afghanistan.

134
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,880
You've got a brother worried
about you but you won't go
to him for help because you don't

135
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,520
approve of him, possibly because he's
an alcoholic, more likely because
he recently walked out on his wife.

136
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,080
And I know that your therapist
thinks your limp's psychosomatic,
quite correctly, I'm afraid.

137
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,560
That's enough to be going
on with, don't you think?

138
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,760
The name's Sherlock Holmes
and the address is 221B Baker Street.

139
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,280
Afternoon.

140
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,960
Yeah, he's always like that.

141
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,200
Hello.

142
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,240
Ah - Mr Holmes. Sherlock, please.

143
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,600
Well, this is a prime spot.
Must be expensive.

144
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
Mrs Hudson, the landlady -
she's given me a special deal.

145
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,360
Owes me a favour. A few years back,
her husband got himself
sentenced to death in Florida.

146
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,280
I was able to help out. Sorry - you
stopped her husband being executed?

147
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,840
Oh, no, I ensured it.

148
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,480
Sherlock!

149
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,040
Mrs Hudson, Dr John Watson.

150
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Hello. Come in. Thank you.
Shall we...?

151
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,720
Well, this could be very nice.

152
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,080
Very nice indeed.

153
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,440
Yes.

154
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,960
Yes, I think so,
my thoughts precisely.

155
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,840
TOGETHER: So I went straight ahead
and moved in. Soon as we get all this
rubbish cleaned out...

156
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:53,040
So this is all... Well, obviously I
can erm...straighten things up a bit.

157
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,120
That's a skull. Friend of mine.

158
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,760
When I say friend...

159
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,840
What do you think, then, Dr Watson?

160
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,840
There's another bedroom upstairs,
if you'll be needing two bedrooms.

161
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Of course we'll be needing two.

162
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:12,680
Oh, don't worry, there's all sorts
round here. Mrs Turner next door's
got (married ones).

163
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:18,520
Oh...
Sherlock! The mess you've made.

164
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,720
I looked you up on
the internet last night.

165
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,200
Anything interesting? Found your
website. The Science of Deduction.

166
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,520
What did you think?

167
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,440
You said you could identify
a software designer by his tie and
an airline pilot by his left thumb?

168
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
Yes.

169
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,360
And I can read your military career
in your face and your leg,

170
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,440
and your brother's drinking habits
on your mobile phone.

171
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,560
How?

172
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,640
What about these suicides then,
Sherlock? I thought that'd be
right up your street.

173
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,160
Three exactly the same.

174
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,400
Four.

175
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,960
There's been a fourth.
And there's something different
this time. A fourth?

176
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,640
Where? Brixton, Lauriston Gardens.

177
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,480
What's new about this one? You
wouldn't have come to me otherwise.

178
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,160
You know how they never leave notes?
Yeah. This one did.

179
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,120
Will you come?

180
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,000
Who's on forensics? Anderson.

181
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
He doesn't work well with me.

182
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,320
Well, he won't be your assistant.
I NEED an assistant.

183
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,920
Will you come? Not in a police car,
I'll be right behind.

184
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,720
Thank you.

185
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Brilliant! Yes!

186
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,600
Four serial suicides, and now a note.

187
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,760
Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson,
I'll be late. Might need some food.

188
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,520
I'm your landlady, dear,
not your housekeeper.

189
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,120
Something cold will do. John, have
a cup of tea, make yourself at home.

190
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,880
Don't wait up!

191
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,400
Look at him, dashing about...

192
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:05,440
My husband was just the same.
But you're more
the sitting-down type, I can tell.

193
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,600
I'll make you that cuppa,
you rest your leg.

194
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,200
Damn my leg! Sorry, I'm so sorry -

195
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,120
It's just sometimes
this bloody thing...

196
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,960
I understand, dear, I've got a hip.

197
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Cup of tea'd be lovely. Thank you.
Just this once, dear,
I'm not your housekeeper.

198
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,720
Couple of biscuits too, if you've
got 'em. Not your housekeeper!

199
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,880
You're a doctor.

200
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,600
In fact you're an Army doctor.

201
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,960
Yes.

202
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,440
Any good?

203
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,480
Very good.

204
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,280
Seen a lot of injuries, then.
Violent deaths.

205
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,320
Well, yes.

206
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,920
Bit of trouble too, I bet?

207
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,200
Of course. Yes.
Enough for a lifetime, far too much.

208
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Want to see some more? Oh, God, yes.

209
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,040
Sorry Mrs Hudson, I'll skip the tea.
Off out. Both of you?

210
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,360
Impossible suicides? Four of them?

211
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,520
No point sitting at home when there's
finally something fun going on!

212
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,920
Look at you, all happy. It's not
decent. Who cares about decent?

213
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,320
The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!

214
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,440
Taxi!

215
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,720
OK, You've got questions...

216
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,760
Yeah, where are we going?

217
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,200
Crime scene. Next?

218
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
Who are you, what do you do?
What do you think?

219
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,960
I'd say...private detective. But?

220
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,880
But the police don't go
to private detectives.

221
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,600
I'm a consulting detective. Only
one in the world, I invented the job.

222
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,840
What does that mean? Means when
the police are out of their depth,
which is always,

223
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,800
they consult me.
The police don't consult amateurs.

224
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,720
When I met you for the first time
yesterday, I said Afghanistan
or Iraq. You looked surprised.

225
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,800
Yes, how DID you know?
I didn't know, I saw.

226
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,720
'Your haircut, the way
you hold yourself says military.

227
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,200
'But your conversation...'
Bit different from my day.

228
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,120
..said trained at Barts -
so Army doctor, obvious.

229
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,880
'Your face is tanned...

230
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,280
'but no tan above the wrists. You've
been abroad, but not sunbathing.

231
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,360
'Your limp's really bad
when you walk, but you don't ask
for a chair when you stand -

232
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
'so it's at least partly
psychosomatic.

233
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,520
'That says the original circumstances
of the injury were traumatic -'

234
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,440
wounded in action then. Wounded in
action, suntan - Afghanistan or Iraq.

235
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,160
You said I had a therapist.

236
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,280
You've got a psychosomatic limp,
of course you've got a therapist.

237
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,160
Then there's your brother. Mm?
Your phone.

238
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,200
'It's expensive,
e-mail enabled, MP3 player.'

239
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,440
And you're looking for a flatshare.
You wouldn't buy this - it's a gift.

240
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,680
'Scratches.
Not one, many over time -'

241
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,640
it's been in the same pocket
as keys and coins.

242
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,840
You wouldn't treat
your one luxury item like this,

243
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,960
so it's had a previous owner.
Next bit's easy. You know it already.

244
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,520
The engraving?

245
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,560
Harry Watson. Clearly a family
member who's given you his old phone.

246
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,800
Not your father,
this is a young man's gadget.

247
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,840
Could be a cousin, but you're a war
hero who can't find a place to live -

248
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,800
unlikely you've got an extended
family, not one you're close to.
So brother it is.

249
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,720
Now, who's Clara? Three kisses
says it's a romantic attachment.

250
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,120
The expense of the phone
says wife, not girlfriend.

251
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,680
Must have given it to him recently,
it's only six months old.

252
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,360
Marriage in trouble then -
six months on he's given it away.

253
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,640
If she'd left HIM,
he would have kept it. Sentiment.

254
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,520
No, he wanted rid of it. He left HER.

255
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,960
He gave the phone to you,
so he wants you to stay in touch.

256
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,120
You're looking for cheap
accommodation, but you're not
going to your brother for help -

257
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,720
that says you've got problems
with him. Maybe you liked his wife,
or don't like his drinking.

258
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,800
How can you possibly know
about the drinking?

259
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,920
Shot in the dark. Good one, though.

260
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,200
Power connection -
tiny little scuff marks round it.

261
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,720
Every night he plugs it in
but his hands are shaking.

262
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,800
You never see those marks
on a sober man's phone,

263
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,160
never see a drunk's without them.
There you go, you were right.
I was right? Right about what?

264
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,440
The police don't consult amateurs.

265
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,920
That...was amazing.

266
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,280
Do you think so? Of course it was.
It was extraordinary,
it was quite extraordinary.

267
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,160
That's not what people normally say.
What do people normally say?

268
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,640
Piss off!

269
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,120
Did I get anything wrong?

270
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,040
Harry and me don't get on,
never have,

271
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,200
Clara and Harry split up
three months ago

272
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,280
and they're getting a divorce,

273
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,760
and Harry is a drinker.

274
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,520
Spot on, then. I didn't expect
to be right about everything.

275
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,480
Harry's short for Harriet.

276
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,280
Harry's your sister.
Look, what exactly am I supposed
to be doing here? Sister!

277
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,720
No - seriously, what am I doing
here? There's always something.

278
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,320
Hello, freak! I'm here to see
Detective Inspector Lestrade.

279
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
Why?

280
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,040
I was invited.

281
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Why?
I think he wants me to take a look.

282
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,560
Well, you know what I think,
don't you? Always Sally.

283
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,640
I even know you didn't
make it home last night.

284
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,480
I don't... Who's this?
Colleague of mine, Dr Watson.

285
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,280
Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan.

286
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,840
Old friend.

287
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,520
A colleague(?)
How do YOU get a colleague?

288
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,840
Did he follow you home?

289
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,400
Would it be better
if I just waited... No.

290
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,520
Freak's here. Bringing him in.

291
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,160
Ah, Anderson. Here we are again.

292
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,080
It's a crime scene. I don't want it
contaminated. Are we clear on that?

293
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,200
Quite clear.

294
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,080
And is your wife away for long?

295
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,760
Oh, don't pretend you worked
that out. Somebody told you that.

296
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,160
Your deodorant told me that.

297
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,280
My deodorant?

298
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,080
It's for men. Well, of course
it's for men - I'm wearing it.

299
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,320
So's Sergeant Donovan.

300
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,720
Ooh... I think it just vaporised.
May I go in?

301
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,240
Whatever you're trying to imply...

302
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm not implying anything. I'm sure
Sally came round for a nice little
chat, and just happened to stay over.

303
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,760
And I assume she scrubbed
your floors, going by
the state of her knees.
