### Evaluating LLMs on forward language modeling for NeuroScout transcripts
To dos:
- [x] Make list of models to expand to
    Forward language models:
    - GPT2, GPT-Neo, OPT (facebook/opt-1.3b)
    - Bigbird, BERT, RoBERTA
- [] Add engine for MLM   
- [] Implement code for each of the models
- [] Add more qualitative discussion to the paper 
- [] Add references on syntax / downstream tasks
